# GitHub Actions Templates
This repository includes a number of example workflow templates which can be used to automate
common GitHub Action workflows. They include:

 - Publishing a Docker image to DockerHub and GitHub Packages using a consistent naming scheme.
 - Publishing a Hugo website to Azure (using Azure Blob Storage and Azure CDN, with a staging and live endpoint).
 - Bootstrapping an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using a repository containing Kubernetes manifests.
 - Deploying a Docker-based application to an Azure Kubernetes cluster, with support for both staging and production environments.
 - Building and releasing a Rust application with support for Windows, Linux and OS X; as well as publishing symbols to Sentry and tracking releases there.
